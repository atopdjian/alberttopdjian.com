    <p>Hi there! My name is Albert but it’s pronounced Al-bear, the French way (the “t” is silent).</p>

<p>Lately my efforts and passion have been towards Co-founding my startup called <a target="_blanl" href="https://processly.io/">Processly</a>. I work with my amazing cofounders everyday to redefine how students learn and how teachers teach as we enter the digital age of learning.</p> 

<p>My life journey has been complex and adventurous but here are some highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>- Graduated with a degree in Industrial Design from <a target="_blanl" href="https://design.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon University</a></li>
<li>- Have been mentored as an <a target="_blanl" href="http://www.cmu.edu/swartz-center-for-entrepreneurship/education-and-resources/experiential-learning/innovation-scholars/">Innovation Scholar</a> in the Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship</li>
<li>- Is a soft-goods designer for <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lexicon-design.com/">Lexicon Design</a> in Pittsburgh</li>
<li>- Worked with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ae.com/">American Eagle Outfitters</a> as a UX Designer</li></ul>

<p>Other than my professional accomplishments, I love to cook, bike, windsurf, and play jazz music on any instrument that I can find.</p>

<p>The goal of this site is to keep track of projects, activities, and thoughts that I have done and to share it with you in hopes that you can learn something from them.
