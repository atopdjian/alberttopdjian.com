# Current Status

We have validated our visual prototype and concept with over 200 teachers, admins, and students. Our development of the app is in full force with our beta completion in Spring 2018. We have a handful of schools and professionals partnering with us to test our beta upon release. If you or anyone else is interested in learning more about Processly and my team of Co-founders, feel free to connect with us through our site or reach out to me directly.
