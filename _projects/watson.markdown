The wats:ON Festival is an interdisciplinary arts festival, bringing an eclectic and diverse range of internationally acclaimed and emerging artists and their work to Carnegie Mellon University. With arts events spanning live performance, interactive installations, art exhibitions, symposia and workshops, lectures, and film screenings, the festival provides a forum for active engagement, interaction, and collaboration between students and faculty from diverse fields within the campus community and beyond.

We looked at wats:ON's existing site and other materials to see how they organized their content and branding. Using that information, we improved the user flow, information architecture, branding, and styling to bring to life their next generation of artists.
