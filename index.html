    <h1>Hi there! My name is Albert</h1>
    <h2>It‚Äôs pronounced Al-bear <a class="bear">üêª</a>, the French way (the ‚Äút‚Äù is silent)</h2>
<p>I'm on a mission to bridge the gaps between holistic design, technology, and entrepreneurship to enact positive social change in healthcare and education.</p> 
      
<p>Currently I am Chief Design Officer at <a target="_blanl" href="https://talkmeup.co">TalkMeUp</a> where I'm leading the UX and design strategy across the platform, growing the team, and working with our customers to build beautiful solutions.</p>
      
<!--<p>During my time at <a target="_blanl" href="https://www.lexicon-design.com">Lexicon Design</a>, I brought to life new products and design directions for companies such as Cardinal Health, Dicks Sporting Goods, and Tumi. As CEO of my startup <a target="_blanl" href="https://processly.io/">Processly</a>, I grew our team, led product development, secured initial funding, and built client partnerships. The goal of this site is to keep track of projects, activities, and thoughts that I have done and to share it with you in hopes that you can learn something from them.</p> -->

<p>I continue to work in spaces around user experiences, entrepreneurship, business development, branding and consumer products. I‚Äôm always looking to broaden my perspectives, surround myself with brilliant people, and apply design methodologies to impact business growth and solve interesting customer challenges. </p>
