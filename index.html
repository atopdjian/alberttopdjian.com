    <h1>Hi there! My name is Albert</h1>
    <h2>It‚Äôs pronounced Al-bear <a class="bear">üêª</a>, the French way (the ‚Äút‚Äù is silent)</h2>
<p>I'm on a mission to bridge the gaps between holistic design, technology, and entrepreneurship to enact positive social change in healthcare and education.</p>
